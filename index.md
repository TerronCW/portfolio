## About Me

I'm Terron Wright, an aspiring developer and enthusiast robotics engineer. I'm currently studying at Saskpolytech, and building internal communications platforms with OuterCatalyst.
Throughout my journey, I have picked up many skills, my favourite among them being spreadsheets, Linux, and far too much knowledge about space.
I'm also an avid Urbanist, and take my bike too far in a city without enough sidewalks, let alone biking infrastructure.

### Robots

I have constructed numerous [robots](/portfolio/robots.html), including a bluetooth-controlled robot from scratch, participating in Skills Canada's robotics competition in 2017, and the Robot Rumble sumobot competition in 2016.

### School

I am currently enrolled at [Saskatchewan Polytechnic](/portfolio/SPT.html), taking the Computer Systems Technology course.

### Future

I aim to help people, either by making useful tools or building dreams. To that end I'm building my skills, and one day soon I will take those skills to the workplace, developing the future.
