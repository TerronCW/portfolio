## Saskatchewan Polytechnic

I am currently enrolled at SaskPolytech, in my second year of the Computer Systems Technology course, a 2-year diploma.
Despite the high course load, I'm excelling at most of the classes, particularly the technical programming ones. I never knew I would like a math class so much! We have also built an AI-powered app to assist students in studying.

On top of the course work, I'm also producing an internal communication platform with the company OuterCatalyst, designed for small companies and organizations to communicate and organize members.
It's getting better in lockstep with my learning, and more exciting every commit.
